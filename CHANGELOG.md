# Changelog

All notable changes to this repository are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

- Removed archived model-run reports, generated traces, and obsolete
  maintenance notes from the repository. Structural tests and golden fixtures
  remain under `evals/`; model-run output is local scratch data.
- Corrected examples that contradicted their own skill. `go-documentation`'s
  `doc-template.go` no longer documents a sentinel it never returns, a no-op
  `Close`, an unused constant, or concurrency safety it lacks.
  `go-http`'s `WEB-SERVER.md` no longer returns a one-implementation interface
  from its constructor, drops the doc line about a `Shutdown` method that does
  not exist, and discards the response write with its reason as
  `go-http/SKILL.md` requires. `go-error-handling`'s `ERROR-TYPES.md` drops the
  `switch err { case ErrDuplicate: }` form marked Good. `go-naming`'s
  `REPETITION.md` wraps with `%w` without a `failed to` prefix.
  `go-generics`'s `CONSTRAINTS.md` no longer shows `slices.Contains` or a
  single-interface type parameter as Good. `go-data-structures`'s `SLICES.md`
  uses `slices.Clone` and `bytes.Clone`. `go-testing`'s `INTEGRATION.md` shows
  `TestMain` returning rather than a `runMain` exit-code helper.
- The dependency ladder is stated one way: `go-database` and
  `OVER-ENGINEERING.md` now match the three rungs `go-packages` owns.
- `check-errors.sh` 1.3.0 reports log-and-return when the logger is a struct
  field (`s.logger.Error`) and when the error is returned wrapped
  (`return fmt.Errorf("...: %w", err)`); before, only `return err` after a
  `log`, `logger`, or `slog` call counted.

## [1.21.2] - 2026-09-19

- Current plugin release with 24 Go 1.27 skills, routing hooks, the shared
  verification gate, and the structural evaluation suite.
